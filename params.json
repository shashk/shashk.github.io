For my Bachelor of Engineering capstone project, I was advised by Dr.Srinivasa K.G. For a brief but eventful summer, I worked as a Research Intern at the Center for Quantum Technologies of the National University of Singapore where I was mentored by Dr.Rahul Jain.\r\n\r\nWhen not churning out lines of code, I like to pursue one of my many hobbies:\r\n* Photography: I love to go on long walks/hikes alone with my camera in admiration of beauty in nature and otherwise.\r\n* Traveling: I have traveled across 15 out of 30 states (and counting!) in India and most of South East Asia. I love to travel around and explore new places although San Diego’s heavenly weather has somewhat quelled that desire.\r\n* Quora: I love the idea of Quora’s unique knowledge and experience sharing platform. I actively read, upvote and post on a variety of topics.\r\n* Team Sports: I am always up for a game of Cricket, Basketball or Soccer.\r\n* Video Games : I’m a PC gamer. My favorite titles are FIFA, DoTA, Call of Duty, Age of Empires. The classics.\r\n* Reading : I enjoy reading classics, spy novels, science fiction and more.\r\n\r\n### Affiliations\r\nSDSC · Oracle Labs, Redwood City, CA · UC San Diego · National University of Singapore · MSRIT-Bangalore\r\n\r\n### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n",
